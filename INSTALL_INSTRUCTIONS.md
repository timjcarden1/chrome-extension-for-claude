5. Remember where you saved the folder!

**Option B: Direct Share** (if Timothy sent you the folder)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Don't delete the extension folder** - Chrome needs it to stay where it is
- **Ignore any "developer mode extension" warnings** - it's totally safe, just not from the Web Store
- **Want updates?** Timothy will send you a new folder - just delete the old one from `chrome://extensions/` and load the new one

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Extension not showing up after loading?**
- Make sure you selected the correct folder (should contain `manifest.json`)
- Try refreshing the extensions page

**Keyboard shortcut not working?**
- Make sure you highlighted text first
- Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` to check/customize

**Side panel not opening?**
